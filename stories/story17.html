    <h1>Samedi, 31 décembre 2022</h1>
    <p>I was 14 when I first came here.
 Everything was new to me. The people, their clothes, their buildings, the way they spoke, the way they laughed, the way they said hello to me. I was very young, and everything felt like a long dream I couldn’t wake up from.
At first, I hated it. Everything looked grey, like a long winter with no end. I was too young to understand that I was being treated differently. As I grew older, I realized that what I once believed were my flaws were actually unique traits I had inherited from the country I came from.
The way I layered warm clothes came from my grandmother, with whom I spent summer weeks helping on the farm.
 The way I did my hair came from my mother, who would quickly get ready before rushing out to celebrate my brother's birthday at school.
 The way I dressed came from my best friend’s older sister. She was in college, and I thought she was so cool. I wanted to be just like her when I grew up.
Every part of me was shaped by the people I had known and loved since I was born. But in this new country, those parts were seen as odd, as flaws, simply because they were different. So, I began to assimilate.
Like many others, I started with my outer self — the way I dressed, the way I styled my hair, the way I spoke.
 But the real danger began when I started to change my inner self.
I tried to erase who I was. I tried to kill the older version of me in order to fit in.
 I began to hate everything that made me who I was, and instead, I tried to become like the classmate everyone else loved.
