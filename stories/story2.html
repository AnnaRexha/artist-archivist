    <p>I have worked at a restaurant ever since I came here.
At first, I worked everywhere and did everything: cleaning houses, scrubbing toilets, cleaning restaurants, and eventually working in restaurant kitchens.

For years, I worked for free for people who promised they would help me. They said they would give me an employment contract — something essential here to get your green card. But in the end, they always changed their words. They blamed me for asking too much, for wanting an “easy way out,” for not having worked enough, for being lazy because I didn’t want to work another year for free.

Eventually, the day arrived when I did get a contract. It was from a woman I had worked for, unpaid, for a whole year — in her restaurant, as a nanny for her children, and as the cleaning lady in her home.

One day, my son got sick. I needed 50 euros for his medicine. I was terrified to ask her. I thought if I did, she would kick me out and never give me the contract. But I had no choice. The government didn’t care about people like us. They said they were already being generous by letting us stay, illegally, and that one day the police would come and send us back.

So I asked her for 50 euros. She looked at me, furious, and said:
“What do you think I am? Stupid? I’ll give you 5 euros and that’s it. We agreed that you and your daughter would work for free for me, and in return I’d give you an employment contract after a year so you could get your green card. Do you know how many people would fight for that opportunity?”

I didn’t take the 5 euros. I said I was sorry.
I felt awful. I felt guilty.
I hated myself for being “too demanding.”

Isn’t that crazy? To feel like you’re in the wrong for asking for medicine for your sick child.

We were alone.
As if we lived in a different world from the people we passed on the street. I’d see children going to school with their clean, beautiful clothes and backpacks filled with food.
I thought of my own.

Three of my children had to drop out of school to work instead, just to have a chance at getting their green cards.
The other two went to school with no lunchbox because all we had at home was flour and water.

We ate basic crêpes every day for weeks.
