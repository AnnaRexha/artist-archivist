    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Galerie des Silencées.és is a living archive, created to preserve the voices of those whose stories have been silenced or overlooked. 
      It is a space for art, resistance, and the reimagining of collective history. Here, each voice is honored in its rawest form—shared, 
      remembered, and given the space it deserves.

      This project emerges from my research, which I have also written in the form of a book titled <em>Fragments du Silence</em>. In it, 
      I question the nature of archives and the power they hold: what is preserved, what is excluded, and who decides. Traditional archives 
      often reflect structures of power, determining which narratives are deemed worthy of survival and which remain inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galerie des Silencées.és resists this erasure. It seeks to amplify marginalized voices, to create a space of empathy, reflection, 
      and connection, and to remind us that silence, too, holds fragments of history waiting to be heard.
