          <p>
            Galerie des Archives is a living archive, dedicated to capturing the voices of marginalized individuals whose histories have been silenced. 
            It is a space for art, resistance, and the reinvention of collective histories. Each voice is honored and preserved in its purest form, to be
            shared and remembered. Our work seeks to uplift and amplify these voices, creating a space for reflection, empathy, and connection.
